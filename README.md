# Hijack - Habitat Image Classifier 

Hijack is an image visualizer that eases the tagging phase of classifying images with the EUNIS system by simply open a folder with images and write each classification. When a user saves the progress, the tags will be exported to a CSV file with the files' name and its corresponding classification. Its UI provide key navigation through the images and key tagging. It's also possible to view each image in its original size.
